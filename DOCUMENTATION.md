Initial idea: to make a screenshare platform for youtube; that is to say, that we wanted to make a website that accomplished two goals: share youtube videos, and chat


ideas for chatroom:
1. utilize a chatroom that was hosted on a separate server (that was public), have two users on our website login and just use the public chatroom
2. utilize a private chatroom that is shared with the user you invite
3. incorporating the cli into a webpage

work:
1. spend a bunch of time trying to implement a website from scratch - perhaps show some of that code?
2. spent a bunch of time trying to figure out how to use the chatroom, whether or not this would come out the way we wanted, whether or not we wanted to use certain things
3.

Future iterations:
1. Make it so emails don't have to be sent to use this; can just invite through our website
